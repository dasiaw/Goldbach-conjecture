# Goldbach-conjecture
Goldbach's conjecture says that all prime numbers add to an even number. 
Using python this program allows the user to enter an even number and
find the two prime numbers that add to the even number they've entered. 
Using Turtle we prompt the user to enter an even number and collect their input to use in the code. 
The answer and the number entered are printed in the console.
